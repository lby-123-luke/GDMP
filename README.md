# GDMP
It is a small gobang decision making programme

using max_min and alpha_beta brach cut 
minimize the zone of the chess to reduce the pressure of the computer
the max depth is 5 sometimes the watting time canbe a little bit long 
I also us partly value update to reduce the calculating time
this is the first version of my GDMP next time I will use qt5 to bulid a beautiful UMI and finally we will 
achieve a real game based on stm32
